This: I'm Bridget and I'm updating this markdown file here.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")
```

We are asking: Is there a significant difference in recommended gun control action for male and female respondents (should guns be easier, harder, or the same difficulty to get)?

Hi Bridget: This is Robert testing to see if our collaboration is working. 

Bridget: data wrangling and counts

```{r}

get_guns <- gc_df %>% 
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>% 
  count(gender, make_get_guns)
  
```
